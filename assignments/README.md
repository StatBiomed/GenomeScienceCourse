## Assignment list
### Assignment 3
You can run this notebook on one of these three options and
**answer the five questions in a report**:
1. colab cloud computing by using [Assignment3_BBMS3009.ipynb](./Assignment3_BBMS3009.ipynb) notebook), you can click [this link](https://colab.fan/StatBiomed/GenomeScienceCourse/assignments/Assignment3_BBMS3009.ipynb) (suggested)
2. local R studio (use the [Assignment3_BBMS3009.Rmd](./Assignment3_BBMS3009.Rmd) notebook) 
3. local jupyter lab with R environment via conda (multiple steps required).

You are strongly suggested to run the scripts yourself. If you still have
